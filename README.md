-Implement three buttons that represent "player 1", "player 2" and “player 3” on website that I created with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
-First, Set a goal that says which player can reach to any specific number, then win this game. (Any specific numbers that you set would display on the above of input number bar.)
-Set a "reset" button to reset the score to 0 and play again and again.
-In this simple game, I used some knowledge and skills of JavaScript, such as DOM, Selector, Boolean, and some loops.
